Note: While using this repository keep in mind the paths of the files. 

1. Create new Workspace
2. Clone the GADEN 
       https:/github.com/MAPIRlab/gaden (ros1)

3. Clone the hector quarotor package
       https:/github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_quadrotor

4. Clone the fleet-of-UAVs-OSL
  
   a. Replace the pakages with the packages included in (Gaden modified pakages) floder (Some instructions are included for this simulation )
   b. Replace the pakage with the package included in ( hector quadrotor modified pakage) (Modified the spwam_quadrotor for this simulation )

5. Follow the gaden instructions
 
  a. run GADEN_preprocessing launch file to setup the simulation (sim_env)
  b. run the GADEN launch file to run the gas dispersal simulation (sim_env)


6. To run simulation  

    a. roslaunch main_simbot.launch (sim_env)
7. New terminal (enable motors) (script)
        fleet-of-UAVs-OSL/src/script
          ./motors_enable_uav_swarm.sh

8. New terminal (controller)

         cd fleet-of-UAVs-OSL/src/sim_env/outdoor_mul/launch (sim_env)
                roslaunch fly.launch 


Using following steps one can create his/her own envirnoment (helped from Gaden tutorials)

	step1:   onshape: create geometry in onshape and export the geometry .stl and .dae formates of the geometry 
	step2: 
                  A: simscale : 
                        1. import the geometry from onshape and create enclosure
		  	2. set the simulation----incompressible (transient) 
                  	3. set the boundary considtions 
		  	4. create the mesh
		  	5. set the simulation time and run the simualtion 
                  	6. download the data .CSV files 
                  B: Ansys Fluent 
                      complete all the required steps and export .CVS file
                        make it readable for the GADEN simulator
        
             if use simsale for windflow data follow the step 3 otherwise follow step4

	step3: Openfoam: 1. open the downloaded file in paraview of openfoam (paraview)
                 	 2. select overall mest and U opention and apply
                 	 3. select the filer cell center and save the data 

	step4: GADEN, 	1, rename the saved data using ./batch_rename.sh floder path
              		2. run GADEN_Prepossing.launch file 
              		3. Run GADEN.launch file
